# GhostBot #
opensource bot for Talisman Online written in python.

### Contributions are very welcome ###

I pretty much got fed up with people charging wild amounts for something that a few people could collaborate on 
and make an equally good version, with complete control to add or remove features as they wish. 

### What Works: ###

hardcoded vars (these will be configurable later):  
attack `2`  
buff `7`  
petfood `9`  
sit `x`  

attack  
petfood  
buff  
stick to start spot  
return to start spot to heal  

 ### Future plans ###

Add a nice UI once the core is solid and functional enough, i chose a terminal UI only because 
I'm familiar in writing them, and it allowed for rapid development.
