# GhostBot #
opensource bot for Talisman Online written in python.

### Contributions are very welcome ###

I figured a few people could collaborate on this and make something useful for everyone
 with complete control to add or remove features as they wish. Everyone seems to have crazy UO scripts
 or their favourite bot app.

### What Works: ###

hardcoded vars (these will be configurable later):  
attack `2`  
buff `7`  
petfood `9`  
sit `x`  

attack  
petfood  
buff  
stick to start spot  
return to start spot to heal  

 ### Future plans ###

Add a nice UI once the core is solid and functional enough, i chose a terminal UI only because 
I'm familiar in writing them, and it allowed for rapid development.
