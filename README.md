I pretty much got fed up with people charging wild amounts for something that a few people could collaborate on 
and make an equally good version, with complete control to add or remove features as they wish. 

Not fully functional at the moment, so far just opens a terminal UI that shows char stats (I want to add alot more) 
and also renames the windows to the character name, kinda handy all by itself honestly.

Future plans are to add a nice UI once the core is solid and functional enough, i chose a terminal UI only because 
I'm familiar in writing them, and it allowed for rapid development.
